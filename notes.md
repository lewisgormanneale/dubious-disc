data we have from generation pokedex API call: uncapitalized name, dex # as entry_number, api url.
need function that assigns, for each generation pokedex - 
data we need to add from api: types, hm moves. eventually location and work out version exclusivity but that can be V2.
build function(s) that:
get types for pokemon
assign sprite, name, removes pokemon_species array
