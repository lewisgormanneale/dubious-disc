Gracidea ([it's a flower](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gracidea)) is a website developed in Angular that hosts Pokémon tools and resources, using data mostly retrieved using [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). 

I first built the site as a new developer looking for things to build to improve my coding ability. I chose to build a website based around Pokémon because of the amount of game data related to the Pokémon series. Pokémon data, movesets, game locations and loads more made for a ton of potential tools I could develop. I mainly work with Angular in my day job, so most recently I rebuilt the site in Angular to get better practice with the framework.

## Features

Right now, the website consists of a [Pokédex](https://gracidea.com/pokedex), which lets you select which game Pokédex you want to view, and includes a Team Planner that lets you plan out a team to use in a game. I've also built a [Pokemon](https://gracidea.com/pokemon/222) page that lets you view details of a specific Pokémon.

## Future Plans

I plan to add more complex logic to the Team Planner that lets users evaulate their team for things like potential weaknesses and type coverage.

I also plan to continue to work on the Pokémon page, increasing the amount of information exposed to the user  (e.g. movesets, forms, location data).

Other potential future additions include things like a Shiny Rate Calculator, Catch Rate Calculator, shareable Team Planner teams, and a lot more. Given the site exists for practice, I'll prioritize adding tools and features that I feel are helping me improve as a developer.
